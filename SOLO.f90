    !  SUBROUTINE SOLO is the routine that calculates vertical water balance at URH
    !
    !---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    !  Discussion:
    ! 
    !    This routine calculates URH flow generation for surface, subsurface, groundwater
	!		pathways and also capilarity.
	!		Evaporation can be reduced to account for drying.
	!
	!	 SOLO is called inside subroutine CELULA.
	!
	!    In general the main variables saved are DSUP, DINT and DBAS
	!
	!	 *Correction from Fernando & Paulo to Parana River Basin!
    !
    !  	Usage:
    !
    !    CALL SOLO(PX,EX,WX,WMX,BX,KIX,KBX,XL,DSUP,DINT,DBAS,CAPX,WCX,DTP)
    !
    !    where
    !
    !    * PX   is the precipitation (input)
	!	 * EX   is the evapotranspiration (input/output)
	!	 * WMX  is the in-soil water storage (input/parameter)
	!	 * BX   is the b parameter for saturation flow in ARNO model (input/parameter)
	!	 * KIX  is the subsurface hydraulic conductivity (input/parameter)
	!	 * KBX  is the groundwater hydraulic conductivity (input/parameter)
	!	 * XL   is the lambda parameter, a porosity index for subsurface flow (input/parameter)
	!	 * DSUP is the water-depth of surface water generated (output)
	!	 * DINT is the water-depth of subsurface water generated (output)
	!	 * DBAS is the water-depth of groundwater generated (output)
	!	 * CAPX is the water-depth of water ascension by capilarity (output)
	!	 * WCX	is the moisture threshold to start capilarity ascension (input/parameter)
	!	 * DTP	is the time step in seconds (input)
    !
    !    uses modules and functions
